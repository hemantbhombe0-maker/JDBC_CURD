# JDBC CRUD Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to perform **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a relational database using **Java JDBC**. It allows Java applications to connect to databases such as MySQL, Oracle, or PostgreSQL and manage data efficiently.

## Features
- **Create:** Insert new records into the database.
- **Read:** Retrieve and display records from the database.
- **Update:** Modify existing records in the database.
- **Delete:** Remove records from the database.
- **PreparedStatement usage:** Prevents SQL injection and supports dynamic queries.
- **Platform-independent:** Works with any relational database supported by JDBC.

## Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or above
- MySQL or any relational database
- JDBC driver for your database (e.g., `mysql-connector-java`)
- IDE or text editor (Eclipse, VS Code, IntelliJ, etc.)

## Setup Instructions
